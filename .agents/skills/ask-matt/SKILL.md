# Ask Matt

You don't remember every skill, so ask.

Read `AGENTS.md` and `.agents/skills/README.md` first. This router recommends
workflows; it does not execute every phase or grant write, publication, or
delegation authority. Atlas's `/spec` and `/tickets` are canonical; the
`/to-spec` and `/to-tickets` names are compatibility aliases.

A **flow** is a path through the skills. Most paths run along one **main flow**, and two **on-ramps** merge onto it. Everything else is standalone, or a vocabulary layer that runs underneath.

## The main flow: idea → ship

The route most work travels. You have an idea and want it built.

1. **`/grill-with-docs`** sharpens the idea by interview. Start here whenever you are **working in a working directory**: it's stateful, retaining what it learns in `CONTEXT.md` and ADRs. (No working directory? Use `/grill-me` instead, covered under Standalone. Both run the same `/grilling` primitive; `grill-with-docs` is the one that leaves a paper trail, which makes it the better of the two whenever a repo is there to leave it in.)
2. **Branch: can you settle every question in conversation?** If a question needs a runnable answer (state, business logic, a UI you have to see), detour through a prototype, bridged by **`/handoff`** in both directions (a prototype lives in its own directory, which is exactly what `/handoff` is for; see Phase boundaries):
   - **`/handoff`** out, then open a fresh session against that file,
   - **`/prototype`** to answer the question with throwaway code,
   - **`/handoff`** back what you learned, and reference it from the original idea thread.
3. **Branch: is this a multi-session build?**
   - **Yes** → **`/spec`** (publish one unlabeled parent specification), then
     **`/tickets`** (obtain approval for tracer-bullet slices and publish them
     with native GitHub blocking edges). Use **`/implement`** only for an
     authorized, unblocked ticket. Start each ticket with fresh context and
     its complete specification; do not substitute local Markdown for GitHub.
   - **No** → **`/implement`** right here, in the same context window.

   Either way, **`/implement`** uses **`/tdd`**, then **`/caveman-review`** for
   both Standards/Spec analysis and concise findings. **`/caveman-commit`**
   supplies the message when a commit is authorized. Review is read-only;
   neither skill performs git or review-publication actions. Reach for `/tdd`
   for a concrete test-first change, or `/caveman-review` for evidence-backed
   branch, PR or working-tree review.

### Context hygiene

Keep steps 1–3 in one context where practical so the interview, specification,
and tickets build on the same decisions. Each `/implement` starts from its
ticket and the complete linked evidence.

Respect the active harness's context limits rather than assuming a fixed
token budget. If needed, compact at a phase boundary with unresolved decisions
and primary-source pointers intact (see Phase boundaries).

## On-ramps

A starting situation that generates work, then merges onto the main flow.

- **Bugs and requests piling up** → **`/triage`**. It moves issues through triage roles and produces agent-ready issues, which **`/implement`** later picks up.

  Triage is for raw incoming requests, not Atlas's parent specifications,
  Wayfinder maps, or implementation tickets. Tickets produced by `/tickets`
  are already reviewed work; do not send them through triage again.

- **Something's broken** → **`/diagnosing-bugs`**. For the hard ones: the bug that resists a first glance, the intermittent flake, the regression that crept in between two known-good states. It refuses to theorise until it has a **tight feedback loop** (one command that already goes red on *this* bug), then fixes with a regression test. Its post-mortem hands off to **`/improve-codebase-architecture`** when the real finding is that there's no good seam to lock the bug down.

- **A huge, foggy effort: a greenfield project or a huge feature build, too big for one session** → **`/wayfinder`**, the most cognitively demanding flow here. When the way from here to the destination isn't visible yet, it charts a **shared map** of **decision tickets** on the issue tracker and resolves them one at a time, producing **decisions, not deliverables**, until the fog is pushed back and the way is clear. Where **`/grill-with-docs`** sharpens an idea you can hold in one session, wayfinder is for the idea you can't, and it's slower and denser, so save it for exactly that, never a well-scoped feature.

  When the map clears, **it hands off, it doesn't build**: use **`/spec`** to
  preserve the map's complete linked decisions, then `/tickets` and an
  authorized `/implement`. Go directly to implementation only when the
  approved work is genuinely small and the necessary decisions are available.

## Codebase health

Not feature work, just upkeep.

- **`/improve-codebase-architecture`** runs whenever you have a spare moment to keep the codebase good for agents to operate in. It surfaces **deepening opportunities**; picking one _generates an idea_ you can take into the main flow at `/grill-with-docs`. It's the survey that finds the candidates; **`/codebase-design`** (below) is the bench you design the chosen one on.

## Vocabulary underneath

Two model-invoked references that run *beneath* the other skills, each the single source of truth for its vocabulary. Reach for them directly when the **words**, not the process, are the problem; or let the skills above pull them in.

- **`/domain-modeling`**: sharpen the project's *domain* language: challenge a fuzzy term, resolve an overloaded word ("account" doing three jobs), record a hard-to-reverse decision as an ADR. It's the active discipline `/grill-with-docs` drives to keep `CONTEXT.md` a clean glossary.
- **`/codebase-design`** is the deep-module vocabulary (module, interface, depth, seam, adapter, leverage, locality) for designing a module's *shape*: a lot of behaviour behind a small interface at a clean seam. `/tdd` and `/improve-codebase-architecture` both speak it.

## Phase boundaries

A **phase** is a chunk of work inside a session: the grilling, the implementation, the QA. At the **boundary** between two of them you have five options, and picking between them is the fuzziest decision in this whole map:

- **Continue**: stay put. Costs nothing, loses nothing.
- **`/clear`**: empty the window, when nothing here matters to what's next.
- **`/handoff`** writes a portable markdown file. Narrow: only for a **new harness**, a **new directory**, a **colleague**, or forking a side task **mid-phase**. What it buys is portability.
- **Subagent**: send a tightly-scoped task to its own window and get a report back.
- **`/compact`** compresses this context and seeds a fresh session with it. The **default**, at the bottom of the tree rather than the first reach.

Read [PHASE-BOUNDARIES.md](PHASE-BOUNDARIES.md) for the ordered tree. Continue
directly by default; use subagents only when the active harness permits
bounded work that benefits from separate context.

## Standalone

Off the main flow entirely.

- **`/grill-me`**: the same relentless interview as `/grill-with-docs`, but **stateless**: it saves nothing locally and builds no `CONTEXT.md`. Reach for it when you are **not working in a working directory** (sharpening a plan, a design, a piece of writing, anything with no repo under it). If you are in a working directory, use `/grill-with-docs` instead: it runs the same interview and leaves a paper trail, so it is strictly the better one.
- **`/grilling`** is the interview primitive itself: rounds, the frontier, facts are the agent's job and decisions are yours. `/grill-me` and `/grill-with-docs` are the two named ways in, and `/triage`, `/wayfinder` and `/improve-codebase-architecture` all run it internally. Reach for it directly only when you want the interview with no wrapper around it.
- **`/resolving-merge-conflicts`** works an in-progress merge or rebase conflict hunk by hunk, resolving by **intent** traced to each side's primary source rather than by picking lines, then finishes the operation. It never runs `--abort`. Standalone and off every flow: reach for it when you are already mid-conflict.
- **`/prototype`** answers one question with a small TypeScript model,
  self-contained HTML demo, or isolated site fixture. Use synthetic data and
  an approved location; if a worktree is needed, branch from `origin/main`.
  Preserve evidence without shipping prototype controls or adding a UI
  dependency to the deterministic SDK.
- **`/research`** investigates primary sources directly for small questions.
  Delegate only a substantial bounded question when permitted and useful.
  Save a cited document only when requested or required by an approved
  workflow; otherwise keep temporary evidence in the session workspace.

## Configuration

Atlas is already configured through `docs/agents/issue-tracker.md`,
`docs/agents/triage-labels.md`, and `docs/agents/domain.md`. Read those files;
if a required file is missing, report the exact prerequisite and ask for its
repair. Do not invent a tracker or invoke an absent installer.
